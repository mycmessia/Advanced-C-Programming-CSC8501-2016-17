# Advanced-C-Programming-CSC8501-2016-17
My exercises of Advanced C++ Programming (CSC8501) 2016/17.\n
This repository is a solution and it contains several projects in every single folder like Exercise6, Exercise7...\n
This solution is created by visual studio 2015 so it includes some headers like "stdafx.h" or "targetver.h" or <tcher.h> if you do not need them because you may need to run these on XCode, just get rid of them.
