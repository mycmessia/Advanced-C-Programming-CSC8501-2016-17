# Advanced-C-Programming-CSC8501-2016-17
My exercises of Advanced C++ Programming (CSC8501) 2016/17.<br /><br />
This repository is a solution and it contains several projects in every single folder like Exercise6, Exercise7...<br /><br />
This solution is created by visual studio 2015 so it includes some headers like "stdafx.h" or "targetver.h" or \<tcher.h\> if you do not need them because you may need to run these on XCode, just get rid of them.<br /><br />
The highlight of this repo is my course work to build multiple encoders and their decoders under constraints below:<br /><br />

My Viterbi algorithm is based on this:<br /><br />

These decoders can tell few discontinuous errors, still need improve.<br /><br />
